# NexusGuard Codebase Analysis

## 1. Core Structure and Organization Issues

### 1.1. Duplicate Code and Modules

- **Redundant Core Modules**: There are two core modules - `server/sv_core.lua` and `server/modules/core.lua` with overlapping functionality.
- **Inconsistent File Structure**: Some files are in the root directory (e.g., `client_main.lua`, `globals.lua`) while similar files are in subdirectories (`server/server_main.lua`).
- **Misplaced Files**: `client_main.lua` exists in the root directory instead of in the client folder, inconsistent with `server/server_main.lua` placement.

### 1.2. Initialization Flow Issues

- **Circular Dependencies**: The initialization flow in `shared/module_loader.lua` has potential circular dependencies between modules.
- **Inconsistent API Access**: Multiple methods are used to access the NexusGuard API (`_G.NexusGuardServer` in `globals.lua`, `exports['NexusGuard']:GetNexusGuardServerAPI()` in various files).
- **Delayed Dependency Loading**: Some dependencies in `fxmanifest.lua` are loaded after they might be needed, causing potential race conditions.
- **Inconsistent Resource Start Handling**: Different approaches to handling `onResourceStart` events across modules (`client_main.lua` vs `server/server_main.lua`).

## 2. Module-Specific Issues

### 2.1. Natives Wrapper (shared/natives.lua)

- **Inefficient Error Handling**: The error handling in `safeCall()` function uses random sampling (10%) which is unpredictable and could miss critical errors (line ~50).
- **Redundant Vector3 Handling**: Multiple implementations of vector3 handling across different functions in the same file.
- **Inconsistent Global Access**: Some functions use `_G.FunctionName` while others use direct `FunctionName` calls.
- **Environment Detection Issues**: The environment detection logic (`isServer`) uses multiple approaches and could be more robust (lines ~20-25).

### 2.2. Dependency Manager (shared/dependency_manager.lua)

- **Redundant Version Checks**: Multiple similar version checking code blocks for different dependencies.
- **Inefficient Fallbacks**: Some fallback implementations (especially for crypto) are very basic and might not provide adequate security.
- **Missing Error Recovery**: When dependencies fail to load, there's limited recovery logic beyond logging the error.
- **Inconsistent Dependency Validation**: Some dependencies (like `oxmysql`) are checked more thoroughly than others.

### 2.3. Detection System (server/modules/detections.lua)

- **Complex Validation Logic**: The detection validation logic contains overly complex nested if-else statements.
- **Redundant Pattern Analysis**: Multiple similar pattern analysis functions that could be consolidated.
- **Inefficient Data Storage**: Health history and damage events are stored in `session.metrics.healthHistory` without proper cleanup, potentially causing memory leaks.
- **Inconsistent Detection Reporting**: Different detection types use different reporting formats and structures.

### 2.4. Client-Side Detectors

- **Inconsistent Detector Structure**: Detectors in `client/detectors/` follow different patterns for initialization and checking.
- **Redundant State Management**: Each detector manages its own state in slightly different ways (e.g., `godmode_detector.lua` vs `speedhack_detector.lua`).
- **Commented-Out Reporting**: Many detectors (e.g., `teleport_detector.lua`, `speedhack_detector.lua`) have commented-out reporting code, making it unclear if they're supposed to report or not.
- **Inconsistent Configuration Keys**: Some detectors use different keys for intervals vs. enabling/disabling (e.g., `resourceMonitor` vs `resourceInjection` in `resourcemonitor_detector.lua`).
- **Unclear Server Authority**: Detectors like `speedhack_detector.lua` and `teleport_detector.lua` have comments indicating server-side validation is preferred, but the implementation is inconsistent.
- **Potential Code License Issues**: The `client/detectors/# Code Citations.md` file suggests some code may be from external sources with unknown licenses.

### 2.5. Resource Validator (server/modules/resource_validator.lua)

- **Limited Whitelist Management**: The `whitelistedResources` table is hardcoded rather than configurable (lines ~35-40).
- **Incomplete Critical File Monitoring**: The `criticalFiles` list may not cover all important files (lines ~25-35).
- **Missing Integration with Detection System**: The resource validator doesn't fully integrate with the detection system for reporting issues.

## 3. Security Concerns

### 3.1. Token System (server/sv_security.lua)

- **Token Validation**: The `ValidateToken()` function doesn't properly handle all edge cases (e.g., missing tokens, malformed tokens).
- **Replay Protection**: The anti-replay mechanism in `server/modules/security.lua` could be improved to be more efficient.
- **Default Security Secret**: The default security secret warning is present in `config.lua` (line ~20), but there's no validation during initialization to prevent using the default.
- **Inconsistent Token Usage**: Some events in `shared/event_registry.lua` use security tokens while others don't, creating potential security gaps.

### 3.2. Client-Server Communication

- **Insufficient Validation**: Some client-sent data in event handlers (e.g., in `server/sv_event_handlers.lua`) is not properly validated before being used.
- **Missing Rate Limiting**: No rate limiting for client-to-server events in `shared/event_registry.lua`, potentially allowing spam attacks.
- **Weak Client Identification**: The client hash generation for token requests in `client_main.lua` (line ~150) uses simple `math.random`, which is predictable.
- **Inconsistent Event Registration**: Some events are registered directly with `RegisterNetEvent()` while others use the `EventRegistry`, creating potential security gaps.

## 4. Performance Issues

### 4.1. Resource Usage

- **Frequent Timer Checks**: Many detectors use frequent timer checks in `Citizen.CreateThread()` loops that could be optimized.
- **Inefficient Loops**: Some functions use inefficient loops for data processing (e.g., in `server/modules/detections.lua`).
- **Redundant Event Triggers**: Events like `NEXUSGUARD_POSITION_UPDATE` in client detectors are triggered more frequently than necessary.
- **Excessive Debug Logging**: Modules like `shared/natives.lua` have excessive debug logging that could impact performance in production.

### 4.2. Memory Management

- **Unbounded Collections**: Arrays like `session.metrics.healthHistory` in `server/sv_session.lua` grow without proper bounds.
- **Redundant Data Storage**: Similar data is stored in multiple places across different modules.
- **Memory Leaks in Event Handlers**: Some event handlers in `server/sv_event_handlers.lua` may not be properly cleaned up, potentially causing memory leaks.
- **Large Table Growth**: Tables like `usedTimestamps` in `server/modules/security.lua` grow indefinitely without cleanup mechanisms.

## 5. Error Handling and Logging

### 5.1. Inconsistent Error Handling

- **Mixed Error Approaches**: Some functions use `pcall`/`xpcall` (in `shared/natives.lua`) while others use direct try/catch patterns.
- **Incomplete Error Recovery**: Many error cases in `server/sv_database.lua` don't have proper recovery logic.
- **Missing Error Tracking**: No centralized system to track and analyze error patterns across the framework.
- **Inconsistent Error Reporting**: Different modules report errors in different ways and at different levels (e.g., `server/sv_utils.lua` vs direct `print()` calls).

### 5.2. Logging System

- **Inconsistent Log Levels**: Different modules use different log level conventions (e.g., in `server/sv_utils.lua`).
- **Redundant Log Functions**: Multiple similar logging functions across different modules (`Log()` in various files).
- **Missing Structured Logging**: Logs are primarily string-based rather than structured, making analysis difficult.
- **Inconsistent Log Formatting**: Different log formats are used across modules (color codes, prefixes, etc.).

## 6. Configuration and Validation

### 6.1. Config Handling

- **Inconsistent Config Access**: Some modules access `Config` directly, others through `NexusGuardServer.Config` (set in `globals.lua`).
- **Missing Validation**: Limited validation of configuration values in `shared/config_validator.lua`.
- **Sensitive Information in Config**: Security secrets and webhook URLs are stored in `config.lua` without proper protection.
- **Incomplete Configuration Documentation**: Many options in `config.lua` lack clear documentation on their purpose and valid values.

### 6.2. Thresholds and Settings

- **Hardcoded Values**: Threshold values in detectors (e.g., `godmode_detector.lua`) are hardcoded rather than using configuration.
- **Inconsistent Defaults**: Default values are defined in multiple places (`config.lua` and individual modules).
- **Missing Adaptive Thresholds**: Most thresholds in `config.lua` are static rather than adaptive based on server conditions or player behavior.
- **Incomplete Configuration Sections**: Features like Discord bot commands in `config.lua` have incomplete configuration sections.

## 7. Database and External Integration

### 7.1. Database Integration

- **Limited Error Handling**: Database operations in `server/sv_database.lua` have limited error handling and recovery mechanisms.
- **Synchronous Operations**: Some database operations in `server/sv_database.lua` use synchronous calls that could block the main thread.
- **Missing Schema Versioning**: No clear schema versioning or migration system for database updates in the SQL files.
- **Inefficient Query Patterns**: Some database queries in `server/sv_database.lua` could be optimized for better performance.

### 7.2. Discord Integration

- **Incomplete Webhook Implementation**: Discord webhook functionality in `server/sv_discord.lua` is partially implemented with placeholder values.
- **Missing Rate Limiting**: No rate limiting for Discord webhook calls, potentially causing API rate limit issues.
- **Hardcoded Formatting**: Discord message formatting in `server/sv_discord.lua` is hardcoded rather than configurable.
- **Limited Error Handling**: Discord API errors in `server/sv_discord.lua` are not properly handled or reported.

## 8. Documentation and Maintainability

### 8.1. Code Documentation

- **Inconsistent Documentation Style**: Different modules use different documentation styles (some use block comments, others use line comments).
- **Missing Function Documentation**: Many functions lack proper documentation on parameters and return values.
- **Outdated Comments**: Some comments in files like `client/detectors/speedhack_detector.lua` no longer match the actual code behavior.
- **Incomplete Module Documentation**: Some modules lack clear documentation on their purpose and dependencies.

### 8.2. Project Documentation

- **Incomplete Installation Guide**: The installation guide in `README.md` lacks detailed steps for all dependencies.
- **Missing Troubleshooting Section**: No comprehensive troubleshooting guide for common issues in `README.md`.
- **Incomplete API Documentation**: The exported API functions in `globals.lua` lack detailed documentation.
- **Missing Developer Guide**: No clear guide for developers who want to extend or modify the framework.
