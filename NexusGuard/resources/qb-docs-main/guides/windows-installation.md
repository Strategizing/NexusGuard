## Artifact and txAdmin

Make a new folder on your desktop and name it whatever you want, download the **latest recommended** FiveM [artifacts](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build\_server\_windows/master/), then extract them to the folder you made

Double click on FXServer.exe to run it. Once loaded, it should open a web browser page

![txAdmin is already bundled in with the FiveM artifacts so running the server starter will launch it](https://i.imgur.com/ZVOCx11.png)

After you link your FiveM account, which it should do automatically, make a password. Then you will be greeted with steps

Go to [keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/) and generate a key. Fill out that information correctly.

Paste your Keymaster key where prompted.
